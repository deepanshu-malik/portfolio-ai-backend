# GenAI Engineer Role Fit Assessment

## Role: GenAI Engineer / Applied AI Engineer

## Skills Match

### Strong Match

#### RAG Pipelines
- Built production-ready RAG system from scratch
- Experience with embeddings, chunking strategies, vector search
- Document Q&A tool with citations
- ChromaDB expertise

#### LLM APIs
- Extensive OpenAI API experience
- Async patterns for concurrent processing
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Cost tracking and optimization

#### Python
- 4+ years production experience
- Expert in asyncio, multiprocessing
- FastAPI for API development
- Production-grade code quality

#### Backend Systems
- Strong foundation for scalable AI applications
- Experience with high-traffic systems
- Database design (SQL, NoSQL, Vector)
- Queue-based architectures (SQS)

### In Progress

#### LangChain
- Currently learning
- Building agents for document processing
- Experimenting with tool-use patterns

### Not Yet

#### Fine-tuning
- Not yet explored
- Planned for future learning

#### Model Training
- Focus is on applied AI, not research
- Using pre-trained models effectively

## Ideal Role Fit

Best suited for:
- Applied AI / GenAI Engineer roles
- Backend + AI hybrid positions
- Building production AI systems
- RAG and document processing applications

Less suited for:
- Pure ML research roles
- Computer vision focused positions
- Roles requiring fine-tuning expertise

## Summary
Strong candidate for applied GenAI roles that value production engineering skills combined with LLM application development.
