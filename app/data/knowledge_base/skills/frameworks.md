# Frameworks & Libraries

## FastAPI
- Proficiency: Expert
- Experience: Primary framework for all microservices at Kogta and Capri
- Use cases: REST APIs, async processing, high-throughput applications
- Notable: Built 5+ production microservices handling thousands of daily requests

FastAPI is my go-to framework for building modern Python APIs. I leverage its async capabilities for high-performance endpoints and use Pydantic for robust validation.

## Flask
- Proficiency: Advanced
- Experience: Middleware development, monitoring APIs
- Notable: Built data integration middleware at Kogta, monitoring APIs at VoerEir

I use Flask for lighter-weight applications and middleware services where FastAPI's features aren't needed.

## Django
- Proficiency: Intermediate
- Experience: Test automation, web applications at Tradeindia
- Notable: Achieved 95% code coverage in test automation

## LangChain
- Proficiency: Learning (Active)
- Focus: Building agents, document processing workflows
- Projects: Experimenting with tool-use patterns and function calling

Currently deepening my LangChain knowledge to build more sophisticated AI applications with agents and complex workflows.
