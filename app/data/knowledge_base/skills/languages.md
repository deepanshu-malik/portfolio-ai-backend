# Programming Languages

## Python
- Proficiency: Expert (4+ years production)
- Use cases: Backend APIs, ETL pipelines, automation, GenAI applications
- Key libraries: FastAPI, Flask, Django, asyncio, multiprocessing
- Projects: All professional and personal projects

Python is my primary language. I've used it extensively for building production backend systems, data processing pipelines, and recently for GenAI applications. I'm comfortable with both synchronous and asynchronous patterns, and have optimized performance-critical code using multiprocessing.
