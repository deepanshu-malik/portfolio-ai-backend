# GenAI & LLM Skills

## OpenAI API
- Proficiency: Intermediate
- Experience: gpt-4o-mini for cost-effective applications
- Patterns: Streaming, async calls, rate limiting, error handling
- Projects: genai-sandbox implementations

I've built several applications using the OpenAI API, focusing on production-ready patterns like proper error handling, rate limiting, and cost optimization.

## RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Proficiency: Intermediate
- Experience: Built complete pipeline from scratch
- Components: Embeddings, chunking, vector search, augmented generation
- Projects: Document Q&A tool with citations

My RAG pipeline includes document ingestion, multiple chunking strategies, ChromaDB for vector storage, and citation support in responses.

## ChromaDB
- Proficiency: Intermediate
- Experience: Vector storage, semantic search, metadata filtering
- Projects: genai-sandbox RAG implementations

I chose ChromaDB for its ease of use, local persistence, and good performance for learning and prototyping.

## Prompt Engineering
- Proficiency: Intermediate
- Training: Completed DeepLearning.AI course
- Focus: Iterative development, structured outputs

I understand prompt engineering principles and apply them to get consistent, high-quality outputs from LLMs.

## Embeddings
- Proficiency: Intermediate
- Experience: Text embeddings, cosine similarity, chunking strategies
- Models: OpenAI embeddings API (text-embedding-3-small)

I understand how embeddings work and have implemented semantic search using them in my RAG projects.
